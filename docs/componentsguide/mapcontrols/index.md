# Map Controls

A control is a visible widget with a DOM element in a fixed position on the screen.
They can involve user input (buttons), or be informational only;
the position is determined using CSS.
By default these are placed in the container with CSS class name `ol-overlaycontainer-stopevent`, but can use any outside DOM element.

## Control List

See menu items on the left.
